**Cloud Bots**

Cloud bots term mean a set of computers that can do a certain task automatically.
Intention of running cloud bots or Botnet can be malicious unless you do it for educational purposes or testing.

Let's say you want lots of computers to do certain tasks for you without owning them. In these kind of scenarios an attacker will intend to use other computers to do malicious tasks such as mining crypto currencies.

A proper device for mining can be an ASIC hardware which come with high performance to mine crypto currencies and can be comparable to many CPU and/or GPU that are running at the same time.

A local computer can also do the same thing and a cloud computer is a virtual computer that is running publicly/privately over the internet and can give services such as Bitcoin mining.

So, a cloud bot or Botnet(Set of cloud bots) is a set of computers that running online and we can connect to them to use them for many purposes which an attacker can connect to lots of computers at the same time to use others CPU and GPU for malicious purpose such as mining crypto currencies.
