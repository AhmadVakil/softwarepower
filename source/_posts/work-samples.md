**What is CMS?**

CMS stands for "Content Management System". A content management system manages the creation and modification of digital content. It supports multiple users in a collaborative environment. CMS features vary widely. They are widely used for either enterprise content management or web content management.

For example, this post has been uploaded via CMS which basically you will login as the administrator and have access to all contents that are available in your website, web shop or your weblog.

This web shop is mobile friendly and can adjust itself automatically to any device that you have. Also, it supported by most of the browsers.

So, let's have a look to this web shop...

## **Manage your orders**

Manage your orders and see who has ordered, what are the addresses and email addresses.

That's it, when you order something online from a website, the administrator of that website will see your order in their CMS and after you have made your payments they will send your product through their local post office from anywhere in the world. 

This is not magic, this is just a piece of software that we develop by spending too much time and effort in order to make a hard task as simple as possible.

## **Customer login page**
