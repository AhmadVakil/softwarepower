(NewsUSA) – Artificial Intelligence is becoming commonplace across major industries and retail is no exception.The retail industry is looking for ways to keep up with the times and many companies have started implementing AI technology across the entire product and service cycle – from assembly to post-sale customer service interactions.Major retailers such as Walmart, Sephora, Walgreens, North Face, Uniqlo, West Elm, and Macy’s are using AI to enhance customers’ experiences at their stores while also improving security. AI Applications in Retail While hardware giant Lowe’s uses small robots to give directions and help customers navigate a large hardware store, Walgreens is using technology to track the spread of flu, based on the locations of customers picking up prescriptions so they can alert customers to the flu activity in their area and stock more flu-related products.Another example is makeup company Sephora, which now uses AI technology in many of its stores to scan customers’ faces and help them choose the perfect shade of blush, lipstick, or eyeliner without having to test multiple products.Meanwhile, a Walmart store in New York is becoming the "store of the future" by incorporating the latest AI technology. The store’s smart cameras will have the capability to alert workers when items are out of stock and even let them know when a bunch of bananas has gone bad. Providing a Customizable Retail Experience Artificial intelligence is being used for everything from preparing packages in warehouses to enhancing security to creating a customized experience for consumers.One company that is delivering solutions to retail and security is VSBLTY Groupe Technologies Corp. (CSE:VSBY) (OTC:VSBGF). VSBLTY is at the forefront of making AI work in the retail space, developing innovative facial recognition software and interactive digital screens that will provide retailers with a multitude of AI features.VSBLTY’s VisionCaptor content management system brings interactive messages to any digital screen and provides insights on customer demographics and emotional states, allowing engagement with consumers in real time.By commanding guests’ attention with dynamic digital displays, custom content can be provided based on what the display camera "sees," while gaining valuable insights in real time. Through engaging digital assets such as animations, photos, videos, and multimedia content, VSBLTY software creates a complete customer experience through digital displays, which can be utilized in transit hubs, entertainment and sports venues, grocery stores, drug stores and, really, any retail environments.What’s more, VSBLTY’s VisionCaptor can be integrated with other technologies, including RSS feeds, QR codes, and Bluetooth."Using Edge- and/or Cloud-enabled digital display solutions, retailers can now enhance guest experience with proximity-aware, interactive brand messaging triggered by demographic, identity or even sentiment, while simultaneously gaining groundbreaking levels of measurement and actionable insights," according to the company’s website. Offering Enhanced Security Features VSBLTY has also developed AI solutions that enhance security.VSBLTY Vector is focused on security solutions that combine video screens with facial recognition software and criminal databases in order to identify "persons of interest" or individuals carrying weapons. Cameras are embedded in screens and can identify individuals alone or in crowds more effectively than overhead cameras, and can allow for demographic and emotional recognition as well as facial and object recognition.By teaching computers how to skillfully interpret their surroundings, VSBLTY software can contextualize all of the information about those surroundings and deliver it to the end-user vetted and streamlined for the particular security application.VSBLTY is publicly traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange, OTC, and Frankfurt, with the symbols CSE:VSBY, OTC:VSBGF, and Frankfurt: 5VS.
