Have you ever thought about what it might be like to relive the best moments of your life, and be able to share them with others? Maybe it’s the dance floor at your wedding. Or the birth of your child or his or her first birthday. Maybe it’s that touchdown that led your team to victory in the last seconds of a game. With today’s mobile virtual reality technology, it’s possible to create virtual memories and it has never been easier to get started.

Humaneyes Technologies, an innovator in camera technology, has developed a user-friendly, dual camera that combines 360-degree photography with immersive 3-D Virtual Reality (VR), all in one simple-to-use solution that costs about the same as a decent DSLR
camera.

“360-degree pictures and video continue to change how we use cameras to capture the world around us,” says media expert Jim Malcolm of Humaneyes Technologies. “And the global adoption of VR headsets, combined with 3-D cameras, is providing even more ways to create virtual content and virtual memories.”

“We’ve done it with the best, from documenting Mako sharks with The Discovery Channel to weightless experiences in the International Space Station, floating more than 250 miles above the horizon.”

“We’re now excited to watch, firsthand, as consumers create their own immersive personal stories,” says Malcolm.

The Vuze XR flips easily from a 360-degree camera to a VR180 camera and shoots both virtual video and photos. Whether you’re recording or live streaming, users can create and share virtual experiences at that moment, and then save them to revisit next week or next decade. Special features of the VUZE include 18-Mega Pixel still images, built-in stabilization, filters, and a VR editing suite. Plus, it doesn’t get more portable.

“Everything can be viewed, controlled and edited, right from your phone, so that you can shoot, create and share virtual videos at a moment’s notice,” says Malcolm. But not everything needs to be virtual; the VUZE also functions as a 5.7K and 4K up to 60fps 2D camera for capturing high-resolution video and pictures to fill out your photo album.

Think ahead to the holidays and how the latest in VR technology can help make unforgettable memories and connect far-flung family and friends. The VUZE XR camera also features live streaming and social sharing for platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, so that you can bring your social media audience into the scene with you.
