**Are you really safe? How strong are your passwords?**

It is easy to guess a password if you rather to choose a simple password that anyone can remember. Most people use a password that they can remember such as date of a birthday, pet name, wife name, car model and so on. In this article I have provided you a file that called dictionary which most of the attackers used to crack login pages, social media accounts, WIFI attack, etc. In this file you can see how simple are most passwords and that is why we must always use combination of upper and lower case letters together with numbers and special characters.
 
The file is a large so make sure you open it with Vim, Emacs or Notepad++.

Note that this is only one example of a list, there are tons of lists out there which you can find them easily after some searches.
