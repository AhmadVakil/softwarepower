**What is dictionary attack?**

Guessing \*\*\*\*password is one of they of ways to open a safe! So if you can guess many passwords and try them on the lock then you might be able to open the safe.

All the password that we guess when we want to open a lock are saved somewhere in our memory which we first recall them and then apply them physically on the lock to try it.

In computer science dictionary attack or brute force attack use the same algorithm but process the attack much faster than human. In these type of attacks there are usually a dictionary that consists of billions of passwords. These password are gathered by attackers and saved in a file to try them again on other authentications.

**So, the conclusion**

Always try to choose a unique password and use numbers, special chars, capital and lower letters to minimize the risk of guessing your passwords by others.
